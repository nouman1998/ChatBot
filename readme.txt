I have used Flask and Dialog Flow to compile and run I would prefer you to create a virtual environment as I have attached the dependencies file(requirments.txt).Use the following steps


1- set the directory of CMD to root folder
2- python -m venv abc (creating virtual env)
3- abc/Scripts/activate
4- pip install -r requirements.txt
5- Flask run
6- It would be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
